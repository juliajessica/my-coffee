          <div class="col-lg-4 column">Ah, the good stuff. If you’re a “I make my coffee in a coffee pot” kind of guy, you’re just about as classic as Frank Sinatra. When you make standard filtered coffee, you’re typically pouring boiling water through a basket of coffee grounds. In comes gravity, which pushes coffee through a filter (note: this is an important step) and voila – caffeination worthy of the gods. Much simpler than the process of making espresso, which is a bonus.

          <div class="coffee"><p>Pour Over</p></div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 column">This is a favorite among high-end coffee fans, pour over coffee (cue the Chemex) is a simple way to brew. You start by boiling water on the stove. Then, pour the hot water over coffee grounds slowly and let the water drip through the coffee grounds giving the body a <u>slow</u> and <strong>bold</strong> flavor.
          </div>
          <div class="coffee"><p>Espresso</p></div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 column">Espresso is its own kind of treat, as well as the foundation of espresso-based drinks like lattes. It’s a highly concentrated form of coffee, carefully extracted by shooting extremely hot water at high pressure through a pick of ground coffee with a specialized machine. It’s got bright, powerful flavours, offering a significant caffeine kick in a small package.
